          <h3>2.4.1 Supplied Designs</h3>
          <p>
            It is the clientâ€™s responsibility to gain authorisation to use any copyrighted, trademarked or otherwise licensed material/logos in their order.
            We will not be held liable for use of copyrighted, trademarked or otherwise licensed logos, designs or artwork as applied to your specifications.
          </p>
    
          <h3>2.4.2 Designs Produced by Us</h3>
          <p class="highlight">
            Any designs produced by us for you will remain our intellectual property and may not be used in any other form without our prior written consent.

          <h2>2.5 Designs</h2>
          <p>
            We may occasionally use examples of custom printed and embroidered clothing we've previously produced in our brochures, websites,
            exhibitions and pitches. If you would prefer to opt-out or keep your relationship to us discreet, please let us know by clearly stating
            on your order or artwork approval.

          <h2>2.6 Samples</h2>
          <p>
            Blank samples are non-refundable and charged at the single unit price, plus carriage and may be subject to an administration fee,
            which will be detailed on the invoice. Printed or embroidered samples are charged at three times the unit price due to set-up and application costs
            and are non-refundable. However, if your main order is the same as the sample order (i.e., no changes to the set up of the screens)
            then set-ups costs from sampling will be credited to your main order, hence your main order set up will be free of charge.
